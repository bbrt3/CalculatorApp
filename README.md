# CalculatorApp
Calculator created using Winforms and C#

It was based on Windows Notepad with few less functions for now.

I've also included some things there aren't in Windows Notepad like loading and showing images and Word documents, but saving those files saves just text.

There are also some key shortcuts available like printing, opening and saving.

Might fix someday! x)
